Given a starting location (x,y) and a set of moves in the form of (direction, steps), you are to derive the ending location (x1,y1)

Imagine you are at (10,10) and are given the following commands.

NORTH 2
EAST 2
You first turn to the NORTH and go 2 steps, which brings you to (8,10). You then turn to the EAST and go 2 steps, which brings you to (8,12)

The final destination is (8,12)

Note: this coordinate system has no boundaries and only limited by the problem constraints

Input Format

The first line contains three integers, X, Y, N, seperated by commas

X: starting X coordinate
Y: starting Y coordinate
N: the number of moves to follow
The next N lines contain a direction (D) and number of steps (S) seperated by a space.

Constraints

1 <= X, Y <= 100
0 <= N <= 1000
D = {NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST}
1 <= S <= 100
Output Format

One line containing two integers X1, Y1, seperated by commas, depicting the final position after the moves

Sample Input 0

10,10,2
NORTH 2
EAST 2
Sample Output 0

8,12
