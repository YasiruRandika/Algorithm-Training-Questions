Consider a triangle of the following form.

image

You start at the top most node and travel downwards along the arrows drawn. Your task is to write a program that would find the optimal path from top to bottom such that the sum of the numbers on the path travelled is maximised.

For example: consider the following path:

image

In this case, the sum along the path travelled is 1 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 11

Now consider this path:

image

In this one, the sum along the path travelled is 1 + 3 + 8 + 3 = 15

Here, it is apparent that 15 is the maximum possible sum in the given triangle.

Input Format

The first line will contain the height of the triangle H The next H lines will contain the elements of the triangle (E), in the form of L (1 <= L <= H) integers on line L, seperated by a space.

Constraints

1 <= H <= 1,000 1 <= E <= 1,000,000

Output Format

One line containing a single integer representing the maximum sum attainable by traversing down the triangle
