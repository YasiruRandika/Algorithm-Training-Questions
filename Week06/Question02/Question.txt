An Ngram is defined as a sequence of N consecutive words in a given sentence.

For Example:

for this sentence: hello world good morning
We can count 2-grams (or bigrams), as follows:

hello world
world good
good morning
We can also count 3-grams (or trigrams), as follows:

hello world good
world good morning
Your task, is given a set of sentences and the value of N, to count the frequencies of all Ngrams in the given dataset.

Input Format

The first line will contain two integers integer L and N
L is the number of lines in the dataset
N is the size of the Ngram
The next L lines contain a sentence written in lowercase english less than 1000 characters in length, containing W words
Constraints

1 <= L <= 1,000,000
1 <= N <= 12
N <= W
Output Format

Each line in the output should contain the n-gram and the frequency (F) in the following format (wk is the kth word in the n-gram)
w1,w2,...,wN F
Ngrams should be listed in reverse order of frequency (highest frequency at the top). In case there are two n-grams with the same frequency, it should output in alphabetical order.
